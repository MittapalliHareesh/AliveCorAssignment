# AliveCorAssignment

Implemented an Android application by following MVVM pattern with LiveData object that has one Activity and two Fragments.

On the first Fragment requesting the User Profile information as First Name, Last Name and DOB date of birth and next button to navigate to the second fragment.

On the second fragment showing the age of the user and present it on TextView on the middle of the screen with the user's First and Last names and back button to navigate back.

Output format should be as

First name: “AAA”
Last name: “BBB”
Age: XX years , MM month, DD days.


To pass data between fragment here i have used ViewModel component with Livedata object.  And If FirstName or LasName is empty we can't take user to next screen.
